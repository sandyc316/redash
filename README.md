<p>This is an attempt to migrate the front end from AngularJS to Angular 6. There are still a few features that have to be migrated:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Query Parameters </li>
  <li> Alerts </li>
  <li> Events </li>
  <li> ...more </li>
</ul>

<p> Few of the features and/or their behavior may be different as well. </p>
<p> Every possible effort will be made to keep the backend in sync with Redash upstream as much as possible </p>
